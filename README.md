# WireForm

WireForm is a desktop-first visual editor for generating WireViz-compatible
wiring harness YAML. It runs completely in the browser: harness data, YAML
generation, WireViz, Python, and Graphviz rendering remain on the user's
machine.

## Features

- Draggable topology canvas with connectors, cables, individual wires, bundles,
  splices, and junctions
- Explicit pin and conductor terminations
- Per-wire-end contact, seal, strip-length, tooling, and termination notes
- Wire colors, labels, gauge, length, shields, loops, and BOM fields
- Hold and drag to select multiple components
- Move, copy, paste, and delete a component selection
- Undo and redo
- Live validation and deterministic YAML generation
- Always-visible topology validation details for every blocking issue and warning
- Versioned editable project files with schema migration
- IndexedDB autosave and recovery, with a local-storage fallback
- Existing WireViz YAML import with a compatibility report
- Persistent named user libraries with template management, duplicate policies,
  selected-template export, and full backup/restore
- Connector photo upload with embedded project/library storage and display on
  both the topology canvas and WireViz-derived preview
- YAML download and component-library import/export
- Native, deterministic BOM CSV export directly from the project model
- Self-contained HTML harness report export with an inline vector diagram,
  connector pinouts, termination data, BOM, and print styling
- In-browser preview through vendored WireViz, Pyodide, and Graphviz WebAssembly
- Static deployment with no account, database, application server, or telemetry

## Using the editor

1. Add a connector, cable, wire, bundle, splice, or junction from the left
   panel.
2. Select a component and edit its properties in the right inspector.
3. Select one port and then a compatible port to connect them.
4. Drag on empty canvas space to select several components. Drag any selected
   header to move the group; use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>/<kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> and
   <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>/<kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd> to copy and paste.
5. Optionally upload a connector photo from the connector inspector. WireForm
   resizes it locally and embeds it in the editable project, user-library
   templates, topology canvas, and local WireViz preview.
6. For a selected connector, expand **Pin terminations** to assign the contact
   and optional seal or manufacturing data for each connected pin. Deleting the
   connection also deletes its termination data.
7. Use the top-bar file controls to create, open, or download an editable
   `.wireform.json` project, or import an existing `.yml`/`.yaml` WireViz file.
8. Choose the spreadsheet icon in the top bar to export a native BOM CSV. It
   includes component housings, modeled wire/cable quantities, contacts, seals,
   and manual connector accessories.
9. Choose the document icon to export a self-contained HTML engineering report.
   The report opens offline, includes the vector diagram and embedded connector
   photos, and is styled for browser printing or **Save as PDF**.
10. Review the generated WireViz preview or YAML in the lower panel.
11. Resolve validation errors and choose **Download YAML**.

WireForm autosaves the current editable project in the browser. Download a
`.wireform.json` project for a portable backup. YAML import deliberately shows
a compatibility report before replacing the canvas because comments, aliases,
formatting, and unsupported WireViz fields cannot all be represented visually.
Connector photos remain embedded in WireForm project and library files; a YAML
download does not contain binary image data.

WireForm stores selected contacts on the exact connector-pin/conductor-end
connection. WireViz has no per-pin contact assignment, so YAML export groups
identical contacts and seals into each connector's `additional_components` with
explicit quantities. Strip length, tooling, and termination notes remain
WireForm-native manufacturing data and are retained in `.wireform.json` files.

Native BOM export runs entirely in the browser and does not use WireViz YAML,
Python, Graphviz, or a backend. Cable and wire lengths are normalized to meters;
multiconductor cable length is counted once, while loose bundle conductors are
summed. Strip length, tooling, and termination notes are manufacturing metadata
and do not become purchasing line items.

The HTML report is generated documentation and works independently after it is
downloaded; it contains no external styles, scripts, images, or runtime service
dependencies. Continue editing the corresponding `.wireform.json` project,
which remains the authoritative editable source.

## Local development

Requirements: Node.js 22.13 or newer and npm.

```bash
npm ci
npm run dev
```

The development server prints the local URL. To build and inspect the same
static files that GitHub Pages serves:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

Before submitting a change:

```bash
npm run vendor:verify
npm run lint
npm test
npm audit --audit-level=high
```

## GitHub Pages deployment

The production build contains only static files and uses relative asset URLs, so
it works under a GitHub Pages project path such as
`https://USERNAME.github.io/REPOSITORY/`.

The included deployment workflow builds and publishes `dist/` whenever `main`
changes. After creating the repository:

1. Push this project to the repository's `main` branch.
2. Open **Settings → Pages**.
3. Set **Source** to **GitHub Actions** if it is not already selected.
4. Follow the **Deploy GitHub Pages** workflow in the Actions tab.

The application does not require GitHub API access after the page loads.

## Browser support and privacy

WireForm targets current desktop releases of Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Safari.
Web Workers and WebAssembly must be enabled. Directly opening `dist/index.html`
with a `file://` URL is not supported; use `npm run preview` or another static
HTTP server.

Harness autosaves and user libraries are stored in browser-local IndexedDB
(with a local-storage fallback when available). WireForm does not include
analytics or telemetry and does not send project data or photos to a backend.

## Planned features

- Wire-list/table editor
- Verified WireViz updater command
- Optional GitHub repository integration
- Installable offline PWA
- Manufacturer connector catalogs and distributable image packs

The [WireViz updater integration plan](docs/plans/wireviz-updater.md) defines
the proposed command, supply-chain checks, compatibility gates, CI discovery,
and rollback behavior.
